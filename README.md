# Madlibs
I did this 'project', despite that I got skills and ambitious for something bigger, due to
problems with programming on my own. That is why I decided that I have to start somewhere.
Thought that starting from low level projects and climbing step by step with consistency will help
me to open my mind for being able to write bigger projects on my own.
